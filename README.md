# saphanafuzzysearch

This code is under construction and not yet released for testing (no SAP HANA instance running on AWS right now). 

The idea was to revamp the client I built during my master thesis to perform fuzzy text searches acrss large datasets (~28 mio.).
In this context, the design decision was actually to provide less configurability in favor of a thinner, more usable client for end-user. Research goal was hence to tune the fuzzy search to an optimum.
