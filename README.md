# saphanafuzzysearch

The idea is to revamp the client I have built during my master thesis to perform fuzzy text searches across large datasets (~28 mio.).

In context of this web app, the design decision was actually to limit the configurability on the UI in favor of a thinner, more usable client to end-users (very Google-like). The configuration of the search happens in the backend. Hence, the goal is to tune the fuzzy search to a customer-specific optimum as part of a consulting service.
